# Twirlie's Avatar Template

Includes gesture emulator, modular avatar, vrc fury, liltoon

## Folder Structure

Included is a reccomended folder structure to keep your assets organized. You don't have to follow it but I find it very useful!

* Assets
  * Attatchments - For Parts, Hairs, Clothing, Accessories
  * Avatar - For the Base Avatar itself
  * Tools - For imported Unity Editor Tools and Shaders
  * Scene - For saving your scenes
